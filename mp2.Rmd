###*Background Information*
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) was formed in 1974 as an independent regulatory committee intended to uphold campaign finance laws. However, this agency has recently been struggling to do its job because of a lack of consensus between members, as well as a lack of funding. The analysis that we have done here is of data that all came from the FEC, from their archives which include information from 1980 to 2012. We are living in a time of great political unrest in which it is becoming increasingly important to be able to "follow the money." The question we sought to answer through our analysis was how campaign contributions affected the number of seats won by party, depending on whether or not the candidate was a challenger or an incumbent. 

####*What we did to the data and why*

```{r, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}
#Organizing initial data so everything can be mapped on one graph
contributions_and_elections <- house_elections %>%
  rename("cand_id"= fec_id)%>%
  full_join(contributions, by= "cand_id")%>%
  select(cand_id:ge_winner, transaction_amt)%>%
  rename("state"=state.x)

house_winners_incumbents_DEMS <- contributions_and_elections %>%
  filter(ge_winner== "W", incumbent== "TRUE", transaction_amt > 0, party== "D")%>%
  group_by(cand_id, state)%>%
  summarise(total_contributions_per_winner= n(),
            avg_contribution_per_cand=mean(transaction_amt))%>%
  rename("Dem_Incumbent_Winners"= total_contributions_per_winner, "Dem_Incumbent_Contribution"= avg_contribution_per_cand)%>%
  group_by(state)%>%
  summarise(Dem_incumbent_number_of_winners = n(),
            Dem_incumbent_avg_contribution_per_state= mean(Dem_Incumbent_Contribution))

house_winners_challengers_DEMS <- contributions_and_elections %>%
  filter(ge_winner == "W", incumbent == "FALSE", transaction_amt > 0, party== "D")%>%

  rename("Dem_Challenger_Winners"= total_contributions_per_winner, "Dem_Challenger_Contributions"= avg_contribution_per_cand)%>%
  group_by(state)%>%
  summarise(Dem_challenger_number_of_winners = n(),
            Dem_challenger_avg_contribution_per_state= mean(Dem_Challenger_Contributions))

Dem_Winners <- house_winners_incumbents_DEMS %>%
  full_join(house_winners_challengers_DEMS, by="state")

house_winners_incumbents_REPS <- contributions_and_elections %>%
  filter(ge_winner== "W", incumbent== "TRUE", transaction_amt > 0, party== "R")%>%
  group_by(cand_id, state)%>%
  summarise(total_contributions_per_winner= n(),
            avg_contribution_per_cand=mean(transaction_amt))%>%

  summarise(REP_incumbent_number_of_winners = n(),
            REP_incumbent_avg_contribution_per_state= mean(REP_Incumbent_Contribution))

house_winners_challengers_REPS <- contributions_and_elections %>%
  filter(ge_winner == "W", incumbent == "FALSE", transaction_amt > 0, party== "R")%>%
  group_by(cand_id, state)%>%
  summarise(total_contributions_per_winner= n(),
            avg_contribution_per_cand=mean(transaction_amt))%>%
  rename("REP_Challenger_Winners"= total_contributions_per_winner, "REP_Challenger_Contribution"= avg_contribution_per_cand)%>%
   group_by(state)%>%
  summarise(REP_challenger_number_of_winners = n(),
            REP_challenger_avg_contribution_per_state= mean(REP_Challenger_Contribution))

REP_Winners <- house_winners_incumbents_REPS %>%
  full_join(house_winners_challengers_REPS, by="state")

house_winners_all <- REP_Winners %>%
  full_join(Dem_Winners, by= "state")
```

```{r, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}
#sorting to just get the number of winners by the type of winner
number_of_winners <- house_winners_all %>%
  select(state:REP_Incumbent_Winners, REP_Challenger_Winners, Dem_Incumbent_Winners, Dem_Challenger_Winners)%>%
  rename("REP_Challengers"= REP_Challenger_Winners, "REP_Incumbents"= REP_Incumbent_Winners,"DEM_Challengers"= Dem_Challenger_Winners, "DEM_Incumbents"= Dem_Incumbent_Winners)%>%
  gather(Winner_Type, Number_of_winners, -state)
```

```{r, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}
#sorting to just get the amount of contributions (average) by the type of winner
average_contributions <- house_winners_all %>%
  select(state:REP_Incumbent_Contribution, REP_Challenger_Contributions, Dem_Incumbent_Contribution, Dem_Challenger_Contributions)%>%
  rename("REP_Challengers"= REP_Challenger_Contributions, "REP_Incumbents"= REP_Incumbent_Contribution,"DEM_Challengers"= Dem_Challenger_Contributions, "DEM_Incumbents"= Dem_Incumbent_Contribution)%>%
  gather(Winner_Type, avg_contributions, -state)
```

```{r, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}
#final dataset to see the data from all states in one table
winners <- number_of_winners%>%
  merge(average_contributions, by=c("state","Winner_Type"))%>%
  na.omit()
```

####*Why we did the dividing-up to get democrat and republican states and what we thought it could show us*

```{r, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}
#Sorting the data so we can see what it looks like for states that had either more democratic or more republican winners

all_winners <- contributions_and_elections %>%
  filter(ge_winner == "W")%>%
  group_by(state, party)%>%
  summarise(winners= n())%>%
  spread(party, -state)%>%
  select(state, R, D)

all_winners_2 <- replace_na(all_winners, replace= list("D"=0, "R"=0))

Democratic_states <- all_winners_2 %>%
  filter(D > R)%>%
  select(state)%>%
  left_join(winners, by= "state")

Republican_states <- all_winners_2 %>%
  filter(R > D)%>%
  select(state)%>%
  left_join(winners, by= "state")
```

####*Setting up the plot function*

```{r, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}
#Setting up a plot function for the three data sets to use later

winning_state_plotter <- function(name_arg){
  na.omit(name_arg)%>%
    ggplot(aes(x= avg_contributions, y= Number_of_winners))+
    geom_point(aes(shape= Winner_Type, fill= Winner_Type), alpha= 0.45, size= 3)+
    scale_fill_manual(name= "Type of Winner", 
                     labels= c("REP_Incumbents"= "Republican Incumbents", "REP_Challengers"="Republican Challengers", "DEM_Incumbents"= "Democrat Incumbents", "DEM_Challengers"="Democrat Challengers", "NA"=" "),
                     values = c("REP_Incumbents" = "red", "REP_Challengers" = "red", "DEM_Incumbents"="darkblue", "DEM_Challengers"= "darkblue"))+
    scale_shape_manual(name= "Type of Winner", 
                       labels= c("REP_Incumbents"= "Republican Incumbents", "REP_Challengers"="Republican Challengers", "DEM_Incumbents"= "Democrat Incumbents", "DEM_Challengers"="Democrat Challengers", "NA"=" "),
                       values= c("REP_Incumbents"= 24, "DEM_Incumbents"=24, "REP_Challengers"= 21, "DEM_Challengers"=21))+
    scale_x_log10()+
    scale_y_log10()+
    xlab("Average Contributions")+
    ylab("Total Winners Per State")+
    theme_economist()
}

```

####*Overall trends in the data for all states*
The take away from this graph is that more money, on average, was contributed to challengers than to contributors, which logically makes sense as these races would be more high energy and high stakes, as there would be a change for the party in control to change. 

```{r, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE, fig.width= 14, fig.height= 6}
#Plotting using the function for the three datasets 

#All states
winning_state_plotter(winners)+
  labs(title= "Total Number of House Seat Winners Per State by the Average Contributions Given in that State 
 for All US States", subtitle= "According to the types of candidates that won")
```

####*Trends for majority democrat winner states and majority republican winner states*

```{r, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE, fig.width= 14, fig.height= 6}

#Democratic states
winning_state_plotter(Democratic_states)+
  labs(title= "Total Number of House Seat Winners Per State by the Average Contributions Given in that State 
 for States with Majority Democrat Winners", subtitle= "According to the types of candidates that won")

#Republican states
winning_state_plotter(Republican_states)+
  labs(title= "Total Number of House Seat Winners Per State by the Average Contributions Given in that State 
 for States with Majority Republican Winners", subtitle= "According to the types of candidates that won")
```

The scatterplot shows that as the number of average contributions increases in a state the higher number of challengers (from both parties) win in that state. Converserly we can see that the more incumbment wins, the less money spent in the state. We can also see that the more wins corresponds with incumbendents. The more money spent the more challengers that win. We saw the relationship between number of wins  and average contributions as the most important and interesting data takeaway, so we mapped it to position because people can most accurately tell position using perceptual hierarchy. The shape of each dot corresponds to whether or not the candidate was a challenger or an incumbent. we chose shape over color because itâ€™s easier to perceive. Lastly, we used the color of each dot to represent party.
